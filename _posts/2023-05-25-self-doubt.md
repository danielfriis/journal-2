Most of us have experienced self-doubt at some point in our lives. It's a sensation that can make us feel both inferior and powerless, and it can be so overwhelming that it causes us to withdraw from challenges that in the moment seem insurmountable.

Despite how convincing this feeling can be, make no mistake; ‘self-doubt’ is not necessarily reality. It is just a product of our mind. A manufactured worst-case scenario designed to deter us from potential dangers. In today’s reality, however, these perceived 'dangers' are often simply fears of embarrassment or failure.

If doubt is indeed an illusion, then why do we tend to give it substance and validity? Why do we allow it to impose a fictitious speed limit on our potential and aspirations? 

Rather than accepting doubt as reality, we should confront it. When doubt begins to encroach on your confidence, take a moment to identify the 'danger'. Ask yourself if there is any tangible evidence supporting it. More often than not, you will find the threat is merely imagined or exaggerated. It might become reality, but you don’t know that yet.

So, with the risk of sounding corny, fuck doubt. Have evidence guide your decisions rather than the fiction of your mind. Trust yourself, take the chance, and run the risk.
