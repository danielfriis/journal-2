    Hi, I'm Daniel. I was part of building SPACE10 — the concept-innovation lab of IKEA. After having lived all my life in Denmark, I've moved to Portugal in December 2023, where I'm enjoying more time with my family, while tinkering with new technologies and brewing on ideas for future businesses. I'm optimistic about technology and aim to apply it to solve everyday problems and improve people’s lives.

    Occasionally I write <a href="/notes/" class="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-zinc-800 dark:hover:text-white">notes</a> about things I've learned or insights I've had. I also keep a list of <a href="/quotes/" class="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-zinc-800 dark:hover:text-white">quotes</a> I like.
