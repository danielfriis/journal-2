  <div class="content"><p>I think many entrepreneurs spend most of their time pondering the ‘best’ idea only to find that the idea doesn’t work, after they’ve built it.</p>

<p>Having found myself in that situation many times over, I’ve come to realise that it’s not the idea that matters most, but the distribution.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard before that “execution is everything” – which I guess it true — but I think it’s more helpful to say that “distribution is everything”.</p>

<p>Sure, execution is important, but what is it exactly? It’s many things, but the <em>main</em> thing is distribution — which is why I’d avocate for focusing on that only. The rest is just house-keeping compared to the importance of distribution.</p>

<p>You can have the best idea in the world, but if you don’t have a way to get it in front of people, it’s not going to matter. On the other hand, even bad ideas works when you get the distribution right.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you get an idea, you should ask yourself: how will people find out about it?</p>

<p>Sometimes you can tap into existing demand by solving a known problem. Other times you need to create demand when addressing an unknown problem.</p>

<p>By known problems, I mean problems that are clearly identified as problems, and painful enough that people are actively searching for a solution. Unknown problems are problems that people haven’t identified yet or have come to accept as part of life.</p>

<p>Grouping them like this makes it clear how differently you should approach the distribution for each type of idea, and how one distribution strategy may work for one type of idea, but not for another.</p>

<p>Get the idea right, by getting the distribution right.</p>

<p>One way to go about idea generation is to see if you happen to have an unfair advantage in an existing distribution channel. It could be that you already have customers for another product, an audience/following, or maybe there’s an overlooked demand that you can tap into.</p>

<p>If you go about it this way, you’ll start your entrepreneurial journey with a tailwind.</p>

    There will be typos, half-baked ideas, and opinions presented as facts here. I'm not a professional writer, and I'm not trying to be one. I'm writing these notes as an exercise to clarify my thinking and to archive insights worth revisiting. If you find it useful, that's great. If you don't, that's fine too.
