  <p>Many of us have been ensnared by the insidious sense of self-doubt, a sensation that can make us feel both inferior and powerless. This feeling can be so powerful that it often causes us to withdraw from challenges that may seem insurmountable.</p>

<p>Despite how overwhelming the feeling can be, make no mistake; ‘doubt’ is not reality. It is merely a deceptive product of our mind, a manufactured worst-case scenario designed to deter us from potential dangers. In today’s society, however, these perceived ‘dangers’ are often simply fears of embarrassment or failure.</p>

<p>If doubt is indeed an illusion, then why do we tend to give it substance and validity? Why do we allow it to impose a fictitious speed limit on our potential and aspirations?</p>

<p>Rather than accepting doubt as reality, we should confront it. When doubt begins to encroach on your confidence, take a moment to identify the source of the ‘danger’. Ask yourself if there is any tangible evidence supporting its claim. More often than not, you will find the threat is merely imagined. It might turn into reality, but you don’t know that yet.</p>

<p>So, with the risk of sounding corny, fuck doubt. Have evidence guide your decisions rather than the fiction of your mind. Trust yourself, take the chance, and run the risk.</p>

    There will be typos, half-baked ideas, and opinions presented as facts here. I'm not a professional writer, and I'm not trying to be one. I'm writing these notes as an exercise to clarify my thinking and to archive insights worth revisiting. If you find it useful, that's great. If you don't, that's fine too.
