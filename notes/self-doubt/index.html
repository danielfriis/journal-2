  <div class="content"><p>Most of us have experienced self-doubt at some point in our lives. It’s a sensation that can make us feel both inferior and powerless, and it can be so overwhelming that it causes us to withdraw from challenges that in the moment seem insurmountable.</p>

<p>Despite how convincing this feeling can be, make no mistake; ‘self-doubt’ is not reality. It is first and foremost a product of our mind. A manufactured worst-case scenario designed to deter us from potential dangers. In today’s reality, however, these perceived ‘dangers’ are not life-threatening. They are often simply fears of embarrassment or failure.</p>

<p>Rather than accepting doubt as reality, we should confront it. When doubt begins to encroach on your confidence, take a moment to identify the ‘danger’. Ask yourself if there is any tangible evidence supporting it. More often than not, you will find the threat is indeed imagined and/or exaggerated. It might become reality, but you don’t know that yet.</p>

<p>Instead of being held back by doubt, have evidence guide your decisions. Flip the script: Trust yourself, take the chance, and run the risk.</p>

    There will be typos, half-baked ideas, and opinions presented as facts here. I'm not a professional writer, and I'm not trying to be one. I'm writing these notes as an exercise to clarify my thinking and to archive insights worth revisiting. If you find it useful, that's great. If you don't, that's fine too.
