  <p>I’ve already written one note on strategy, attempting to distil everything I know on the topic into something more simple and actionable than what I’ve found in the literature.</p>

<p>That note is still a very valid take on how to think about and work with strategy, but I’ve since come across another approach which is even more simple, and possibly more precise and actionable.</p>

<p>In fact, it might be too simple, which is why I’m not updating the original note, but instead writing this new one.</p>

<p>Anyways, the framework goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Problem</li>
  <li>Cause</li>
  <li>Solution</li>
</ol>

<p>As I wrote in my original note, strategy is problem-solving, and this is problem-solving at its essence.</p>

<p>I learned about it via Patrick Campbell, the founder and CEO of Profitwell, as he was interviewed for <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/lennys-podcast-product-growth-career/id1627920305?i=1000600396746">“Lenny’s Podcast”</a>.</p>

<p>During the interview, Patrick also makes another excellent point that while this is a great framework for building strategy, it’s also a great way to structure presentations. I agree with him 100%.</p>

<p>Many people struggle with presenting their ideas clearly. This framework is a great way to convey your ideas in a logical structure that makes it easy for other people to follow.</p>
